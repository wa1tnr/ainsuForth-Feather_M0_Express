# WTF

unmodified for this SNAPSHOT.  29 July 2017.

What the finnegan is going on here?

At present, a tear-down (early June, 2017) of the entire
structure of the program.  It was a lot of code in a very
few files.

The new approach won't be much like that, although the
running code will be remarkably similar to the existing
(YAFFA-ARM) code base.

The architecture is all from the original Author.

Intent is for the present contributing author to be able
to reorganize the code into much smaller chunks.

For that, a full tear-down, then rebuild.
